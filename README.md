A metro map of [Rauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauma,_Finland?), my childhood hometown. The map is planned around the imaginary problem that the population of the city grow twentyfold without spreading out, which would necessitate a large-scale public transportation system. This map is one proposal to do it.
